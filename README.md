# Network Port Scan & Analysis (Nmap + Wireshark)

This project scans a vulnerable Metasploitable 2 VM using Nmap, analyzes traffic with Wireshark, and identifies security risks from open ports.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux (attacker)
- Metasploitable2 (target)
- Nmap (`-sS` and `-A`)
- Wireshark

## Contents
- `scan-results/`: Raw Nmap outputs + screenshots
- `analysis/`: Breakdown of ports/services and risks
- `wireshark-captures/`: Screenshots and PCAP file
- `report/`: Final compiled summary (PDF)

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Performed TCP SYN and aggressive scans
- Identified services like SSH, SMB, Telnet, FTP
- Understood risks of open ports
- Observed live packet capture during scan
